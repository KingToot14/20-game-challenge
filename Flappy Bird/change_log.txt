Trying to get the full game loop down - main menu => gameplay => death => score => restart

Gameplay:
	Added more obstacles so there's actually a challenge
	Added a button ('R') to restart the game
	Added a button ('backspace') to reset the high score
	Added a button ('esc') to quit the game
	Only begin movement (owl and obstacles) after the space bar has been pressed for the first time

Polish:
	Hides the owl's shadow on death
	Changed the collectible animations to use the built in Time class and not their own counters

UI:
	High score now only updates after death
	Added a 'game over' menu showing the score with a special indicator if a new high score was reached
	Added a main menu scene showing the title and some controls
	Changed score text colors

Today I did a little bit of polish as well as working on the score system and UI

Polish:
	Added some animation (using sine waves) to the collectibles (bobbing up/down and rotating back and forth)
	When the player dies, set the owl's rotation to be sharply downwards (80 degrees)

Score System:
	Added a high score system that maintains the highest score between plays
	Added a save system to maintain the high score even after the game has been closed and reopened (high.score)

UI Changes:
	Changed the color of the score text to a green (to match the leaves on the twig collectibles)
